//! # A Whorlwind Tour in Building a Rust Async Exectuor
//!
//! whorl is a self contained library to run asynchronous Rust code with the
//! following goals in mind:
//!
//! - Keep it in one file. You should be able to read this code beginning to end
//!   like a literate program and understand what each part does and how it fits
//!   into the larger narrative. The code is organized to tell a story, not
//!   necessarily how I would normally structure Rust code.
//! - Teach others what is going on when you run async code in Rust with a runtime
//!   like tokio. There is no magic, just many synchronous functions in an async
//!   trenchcoat.
//! - Explain why different runtimes are incompatible, even if they all run async
//!   programs.
//! - Only use the `std` crate to show that yes all the tools to build one exist
//!   and if you wanted to, you could.
//! - Use only stable Rust. You can build this today; no fancy features needed.
//! - Explain why `std` doesn't ship an executor, but just the building blocks.
//!
//! What whorl isn't:
//! - Performant, this is an adaptation of a class I gave at Rustconf a few
//!   years back. Its first and foremost goal is to teach *how* an executor
//!   works, not the best way to make it fast. Reading the tokio source
//!   code would be a really good thing if you want to learn about how to make
//!   things performant and scalable.
//! - "The Best Way". Programmers have opinions, I think we should maybe have
//!   less of them sometimes. Even me. You might disagree with an API design
//!   choice or a way I did something here and that's fine. I just want you to
//!   learn how it all works.
//! - An introduction to Rust. This assumes you're somewhat familiar with it and
//!   while I've done my best to break it down so that it is easy to understand,
//!   that just might not be the case and I might gloss over details given I've
//!   done Rust for over 6 years at this point. Expert blinders are real and if
//!   things are confusing, do let me know in the issue tracker. I'll try my best
//!   to make it easier to grok, but if you've never touched Rust before, this is
//!   in all honesty not the best place to start.
//!
//! With all of that in mind, let's dig into it all!

pub mod futures {
    //! This is our module to provide certain kinds of futures to users. In the case
    //! of our [`Sleep`] future here, this is not dependent on the runtime in
    //! particular. We would be able to run this on any executor that knows how to
    //! run a future. Where incompatibilities arise is if you use futures or types
    //! that depend on the runtime or traits not defined inside of the standard
    //! library. For instance, `std` does not provide an `AsyncRead`/`AsyncWrite`
    //! trait as of Oct 2021. As a result, if you want to provide the functionality
    //! to asynchronously read or write to something, then that trait tends to be
    //! written for an executor. So tokio would have its own `AsyncRead` and so
    //! would ours for instance. Now if a new library wanted to write a type that
    //! can, say, read from a network socket asynchronously, they'd have to write an
    //! implementation of `AsyncRead` for both executors. Not great. Another way
    //! incompatiblities can arise is when those futures depend on the state of the
    //! runtime itself. Now that implementation is locked to the runtime.
    //!
    //! Sometimes this is actually okay; maybe the only way to implement
    //! something is depending on the runtime state. In other ways it's not
    //! great. Things like `AsyncRead`/`AsyncWrite` would be perfect additions
    //! to the standard library at some point since they describe things that
    //! everyone would need, much like how `Read`/`Write` are in stdlib and we
    //! all can write generic code that says I will work with anything that I
    //! can read or write to.
    //!
    //! This is why, however, things like Future, Context, Wake, Waker etc. all
    //! the components we need to build an executor are in the standard library.
    //! It means anyone can build an executor and accept most futures or work
    //! with most libraries without needing to worry about which executor they
    //! use. It reduces the burden on maintainers and users. In some cases
    //! though, we can't avoid it. Something to keep in mind as you navigate the
    //! async ecosystem and see that some libraries can work on any executor or
    //! some ask you to opt into which executor you want with a feature flag.

        // A Future is the fundamental block of any async executor. It is a trait
        // that types can make or an unnameable type that an async function can
        // make. We say it's unnameable because you don't actually define the type
        // anywhere and just like a closure you can only specify its behavior with
        // a trait. You can't give it a name like you would when you do something
        // like `pub struct Foo;`. These types, whether nameable or not, represent all
        // the state needed to have an asynchronous function. You poll the future to
        // drive its computation along like a state machine that makes transistions
        // from one state to another till it finishes. If you reach a point where it
        // would yield execution, then it needs to be rescheduled to be polled again
        // in the future. It yields though so that you can drive other futures
        // forward in their computation!
        //
        // This is the important part to understand here with the executor: the
        // Future trait defines the API we use to drive forward computation of it,
        // while the implementor of the trait defines how that computation will work
        // and when to yield to the executor. You'll see later that we have an
        // example of writing a `Sleep` future by hand as well as unnameable async
        // code using `async { }` and we'll expand on when those yield and what it
        // desugars to in practice. We're here to demystify the mystical magic of
        // async code.

        // Ah Pin. What a confusing type. The best way to think about `Pin` is that
        // it records when a value became immovable or pinned in place. `Pin` doesn't
        // actually pin the value, it just notes that the value will not move, much
        // in the same way that you can specify Rust lifetimes. It only records what
        // the lifetime already is, it doesn't actually create said lifetime! At the
        // bottom of this, I've linked some more in depth reading on Pin, but if you
        // don't know much about Pin, starting with the standard library docs isn't a
        // bad place.
        //
        // Note: Unpin is also a confusing name and if you think of it as
        // MaybePinned you'll have a better time as the value may be pinned or it
        // may not be pinned. It just marks that if you have a Pinned value and it
        // moves that's okay and it's safe to do so, whereas for types that do not
        // implement Unpin and they somehow move, will cause some really bad things
        // to happen since it's not safe for the type to be moved after being
        // pinned. We create our executor with the assumption that every future we
        // get will need to be a pinned value, even if it is actually Unpin. This
